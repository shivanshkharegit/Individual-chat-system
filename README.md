# Individual Chat System using Java

Individual Chat System using Java Programming
This project follows the core concept of personal chat application like- WhatsApp.
It uses a client-Server architecture where each user connects to a central server.
Messages are transmitted in real time using Java Socket Programming.
Multithreading is implemented on the server side to handle multiple users simultaneously.
This system demonstrates how one-to-one messaging applications work at the backend level, includin messages sending, receiving, and sesion handling.
